# zimg DBx

Aparently, I'm obsessed about images and databases.
This is the X-th time I'm working on this idea.

Previous implementations:

- https://github.com/croqaz/img-db -- Python CLI app that's closest to what I want
- https://github.com/ShinyTrinkets/rusty-img-db -- crappy attempt to rewrite img-DB in Rust
- https://github.com/croqaz/priv-briefcase -- Private briefcase v2, based on a much older implementation
- https://github.com/croqaz/private-briefcase -- Private briefcase v1 GUI
